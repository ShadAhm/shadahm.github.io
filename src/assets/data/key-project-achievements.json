The two that I choose to name here are Jobs API, and Subcontractor Portal. This company keeps tracks of millions of facilities maintenance jobs performed by subcontractors, across 3 countries. The subcontractor portal (which integrates with Jobs API) allows the subcontractors to close down jobs, submit invoices, upgrades, and browse documents. The subcontractor portal uses a dual authorization system with ADFS-based SSO (for internal users), and OpenID Connect (for external users). The Jobs API uses OAuth authentication.",
